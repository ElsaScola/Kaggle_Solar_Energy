# Solar Energy Prediction
### Overview
Given a dataset from the Kaggle competition [”AMS 2013-2014 Solar Energy Prediction Contest”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ams-2014-solar-energy-prediction-contest/) the goal of this project is to use meteorological variables forecasted by GFS as input attributes to a machine learning model that is able to estimate how much solar energy is going to be produced at one of the solar plants in Oklahoma.
